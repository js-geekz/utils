# Use Object Like An Array

Arrays are so smooth to use, especially iterations. No doubt they always end up being our first choice for any kinda data storage. But we all know how big difference the O(1) and O(n) makes in time complexity. 

To solve this problem, and bridge the gaps between Object and Array APIs, have introduced this ArrayFy Utility which will convert your object into an Array and allow you to perform similar operations. 

I will be working to ensure that we can still avail the array like notation the object, but that's still in design 

### Usage

```sh
